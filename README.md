# Pod-hopper
A site that finds new podcasts for you to listen to based on what podcasts you enjoy, track those podcasts 
based on releases of episodes and organises shows so you don't have a cluttered feed to sort through.

I personally find myself having to listen to lots of I podcasts that I dont enjoy just to find one I like as much as the ones 
I currently listen to.
